# Slay the Spire - Curse Cards

Curses are negative cards that, unlike Status cards, stay in your deck outside of combat. Under normal circumstances, all curses are **Unplayable**, and many impose an additional negative effect.

## Curse Card Categories

### Randomly Generated Curses (Removable)
When an effect (such as Cursed Key or Transform) generates a random curse, it can only become one of these 10 curses:
- Clumsy
- Decay
- Doubt
- Injury
- Normality
- Pain
- Parasite
- Regret
- Shame
- Writhe

### Special Curse (Removable)
- **Pride** - The only removable curse that can be played (obtained from Grotesque Trophy in Endless runs)

### Non-Removable Curses
These curses cannot be removed from your deck at shops or with Remove Card events:
- Ascender's Bane
- Curse of the Bell
- Necronomicurse
